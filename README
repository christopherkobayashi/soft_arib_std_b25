Japanese TV Standard "ARIB STD-B25" implementation without B-CAS Card
You can use this code for your TV product.

In addition:
If you have plan to design TV hardware product, you can embed bcasid.inf into firmware, because bcasid.inf is fixed value.

Usage:

cd bcasid
make
./bcasid >/etc/bcasid.inf

cd ../libecmdecoder
make
make install

cd ../softarib25
make
make install

Have fun! 
I expect succsess of your business in Japan.
